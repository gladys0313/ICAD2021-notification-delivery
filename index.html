                <p> We present a novel method to deliver artificial notification sounds that have been commonly used in digital devices and for popular applications in a less intrusive but still adequately noticable manner. </p>

                <p> More specifically, we first transfer the musical timbre of a notification sound into the timbre of the background music that a user is listening to, while preserving the original notification melody envelope to still associate the notification with its interpretation. Next, we harmoniously embed the timbre-transformed notification into the background music for delivery. In order to achieve a seamless integration, we adjust the amplitude, tempo, and the overall octave level of the notification to match these features of the music, and we embed the notification with fade-in and fade-out effects, while the embedding spot is selected by algorithmically checking and finding the segment of the music that shares the most similar musical features with the notification sound. </p>

                <p> We collected 81 popular notification sounds from iOS/Android system and applications like Skype, please refer to our <cite><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1As4qLaiQs7FgjWPCr_jWbk5YSZSj1a8_?usp=sharing">notification sound dataset</a></cite>). </p>
